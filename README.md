# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this Prework Study Guide project was to not only get my feet wet in the world of coding. But to create a organized place to save current and future coding projects as I embark on this journey to becoming a Software Engineer. Rather then saving my progress in random folders on my PC. This project has given me a centralized location for all the work to come as I progress through the bootcamp. So far, I've learned the mindset and work ethic of a software developer. As well as what tools and resources to use as a software developer. And of course, the fun part. I've gotten a great introduction into HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In the DevTools console of the project, you will find JavaScript running. This script will provide a list of all the topics and pick one that we can study first. This project will also provide good practice in utilizing Github repos via the command line.
